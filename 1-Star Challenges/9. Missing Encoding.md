# Missing Encoding
Seeing the title of the challenge, we can assume that the challenge involves some kind of encoding, and since we are talking about web applications, 
the most common encoding that comes to mind would definitely be the URL encoding that we see so often.

The challenge also mentions photos and I happen to see a `Photo Wall` section on the left menu 

Navigating to the `Photo Wall`, we see that there is indeed a missing photo:

After playing around and not finding anything besides a twitter(X) redirect, I decided to go for the good 'ol inspect tool

Here I saw something off about the image, the file is definitely referenced there but why isn't it loading?, maybe it was corrupted?. 
But thinking back to the context of the challenge, I looked at the other images on the screen and saw that there were some weird encodings in the source filename:

It looked like the symbols on the filename were encoded using `%xx` representation

Me at the time, not knowing URL Encoding very well, took sometime to realise that this was a problem because on the missing file, the image wasnt showing a source
indicating that it might be referenced wrongly.

So I went Googling it and found a list of symbols that need to be encoded in URLs by `https://docs.mapp.com/docs/url-encoding-and-what-characters-are-valid-in-a-uri`

Now in the Elements section, I tried to encode the `#` into its URL encoded version:

After changing the Encoding something did happen, but it seems like it was blocked as indicated by the warning, so i tried the same on firefox instead of chrome:

And behold, we finally got to see the adorable kitty in all its glory and successfully completed the challenge
