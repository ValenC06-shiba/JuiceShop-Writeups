# Outdated Allowlist
The challenge asks us to find a crypto currency address in the web app, I noticed here that they also said `Redirect` which gives me a baseline on what to look for in the 
inspect tool:

<img width="1026" height="724" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6070f30-b354-4b14-94c2-743416e29d3e" /> <br/><br/>

In the main.js file, we found some links that look like crypto currencies and try to go to the redirect:
Seeing as the link is `./redirect?to=https:%2F%2Fblockchain.info%2Faddress%2F1AbKfgvw9psQ41NbLi8kufDQTezwG8DRZm`, we append this to the end of localhost/3000:

And there we have it, the redirect is completed, when we go back to JuiceShop the challenge will be marked as completed.
