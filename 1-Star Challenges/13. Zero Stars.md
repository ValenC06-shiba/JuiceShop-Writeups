# Zero Stars
Now, seeing as this challenge requires us to manipulate input, my first idea was to go back to Burpsuite again and try to manipulate the review from there:

Here we can see the POST request responsible for the review and there we can see that sending a review requires 4 entries which are:
captchaid, captcha, comment (with username if applicable), and rating.

To solve the challenge, we can manipulate the rating portion of the request and see if it is succcessful:

We have a successful POST request yayyy, although this is only because of the improper captcha implementation,

In this Captcha, we see that it is linked with a captcha id and answer, this means that as long as we can solve 1 captcha, we can use that data to send requests 
rendering the captcha obsolete

And with that we finished the 1 star challenges apart from the extra coding questions (the coding questions give answers after multiple wrong attempts)
