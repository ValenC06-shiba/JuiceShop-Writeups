# Bully Chatbot
From the name of the challenge I think we can get the jist of what we are supposed to do, further impliedby the brute-force tag on the challenge

Going into the `Support Chat` tab on the left panel of the screen, we can get to the chat bot

Now we can start to bully the chatbot with some prompts:

The chatbot appears to give a fixed set of responses depending on what we ask, we can continue to ask it to give the coupon and eventually we get it:
