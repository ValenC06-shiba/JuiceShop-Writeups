# Repetitive Registration
Looking at the challenge, I wasn't quite sure what the challenge was trying to achieve, so I went to the hints section to get a better understanding:

So the challenge wants us to bypass the repeat password stage, this leads me to try out burpsuite to see if i can manipulate the requests to bypass that.

Going to the register user page, we try to send a valid request and see if Burpsuite can replicate it:

In Burpsuite, we can see the POST request that sends the valid new user details to the server, 
now since we know the format, we can try and register another user without repeating our password:

# Success!!
Here we can see that we sent a new user registration with the repeat password field left blank, 
just remember to not use the same email as the server will issue a warning.

Going back to JuiceShop we can see that the challenge has successfully been cleared
