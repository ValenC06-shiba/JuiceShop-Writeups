# Playing with UI
The first step is finding the Score board so i began by playing around with the UI of the application and didnt find any scoreboards. <br/><br/>

# Inspect
Assuming my eyes aren't that bad, I decided to take a more detailed approach by using the inspect tool on the browser to look for more clues. 

There I found several js files on the sources panel, and seeing as we're looking for a scoreboard, I decided to go to the main.js file and search for a subdirectory beginning with "score".<br/><br/>

# Navigate to subdirectory
Seeing that there is a subdirectory "/score-board" I tried to navigate to it. <br/><br/>

# Success
Now we have unlocked the scoreboard where we can start solving challenges
