# Manipulate Basket
we are supposed to add a new item to another user's basket and not just change the quantity of an existing item,
to do this we should start with an empty basket, where I'm using the testing account for a base:

In Burpsuite, we can see that the basket for this user is basket 6:

Now we can change to another user (I used John's account) and try to update the basket from there:

This gives an error however not allowing us to update another users basket, however, I discovered that adding an additional BasketID updates both baskets and solves the challenge:
