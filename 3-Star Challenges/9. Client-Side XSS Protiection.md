# Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism.
Seeing as this is a persisted or stored XSS attack, 
we need to find a way to save a string into the server which we can then intercept in burpsuite and replace with our payload

Some fields come to mind such as the username of our profile, user registration, reviews

# Reviews
lets try from reviews:

<img width="1209" height="743" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1f25164-9226-4365-b4df-50b5224ab6ed" />

it looks like the server sanitizes input in the reviews, not surprising since I don't think there were any sanitisation on the client side

# User Registration

So as we know the Registration page has restrictions on username characters, but does that mean the server double checks these inputs?

Since if only the client sanitises these inputs, we can easily intercept and change the contents in burpsuite.

First, we enter a legitimate user registration, then we edit it in burpsuite:
*Remember to escape the quotations in the original payload

Now we have a persisted XSS in the server which takes place everytime anyone enters the administration panel, this is because everytime they do, 
the server reads the data and interprets our payload as javascript executable instead of a username string, 
this causes it to run the payload instead of displaying the username as seen here:

when we scroll to the last page of users in the administration panel, the system tries to display our newly created user but ends up running our payload instead.
