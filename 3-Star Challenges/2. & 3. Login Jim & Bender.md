# Login Jim
We can solve this challenge in multiple ways since it only requires us to login to the User's account without any restrictions

# SQL injection Jim
Since we know Jim's user email through the administration panel, we can craft an SQL injection that will log us in without his password:

Similar to Jim's injection we end the email address with a `'` and comment out the rest to get the injection to use the email address only
