# Bjoern's Favorite Pet
Going to the administration panel, we find several emails with Bjoern's name being: `bjoern.kimminich@gmail.com`, `bjoern@juice-sh.op`, and `bjoern@owasp.org`

Looking at the challenge description, we find that the appropriate email is his "OWASP" email which is `bjoern@owasp.org` 
with the security question of `Name of your favorite pet`

Looking at the hint of the challenge, it looks like we have to stalk Bjoern a little bit,
As stated in the challenge hint, it looks like Bjoern did reveal some information in a video.
After looking for sometime we find that the answer to the security question is Zaya.
