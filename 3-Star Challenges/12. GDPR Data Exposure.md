# GDPR Data Exposure
The challenge asks us to login with Chris's erased account, in the hint section, we are also told to look for the deleted account in the database.
This leads to us reusing the previously completed SQL injection to get the Users table:

**Note: executing this request, we also accidentally solved a 4-star challenge: User Credentials*

The injection used here reuses the previous format to get the username, email, and password from the users table:

`asdf'))+UNION+SELECT+username,email,password,4,5,6,7,8,9+FROM+Users+--+`



After collecting the data and organizing it, we find Chris's email and password hash:

Submitting the password hash to a hash analyzer reveals that it is using md5 hashing algorithm:

Since we know the hash is vulnerable, we can try to brute force the hash to find the correct password.
Alternatively, we can use another injection in the login page to quickly login to chris's account without a password which is how I did it:

With that, the challenge is solved through repeated SQL query manipulation
