# Upload Size
When trying to upload a file that is more than 100kb, the complaints form won't allow the complaint to be submitted, 
instead I opted to try and intercept and alter a valid file upload.

I asked an ai to make a 98kb txt file and appended an additional `.zip` at the end, this when uploaded and intercepted looks like

We can see the AI just spammed a whole bunch of "A"s until it reached 98kb, and the contents were seperate from the filename and type, so I thought "what if i just extended the contents of the file to be longer?", in the end it worked and the challenge was solved:

</br></br></br>


# Upload Type

Originally I uploaded the `x.xml` file in the request but here I altered the filename to be the rockoyu.txt, and the type to just text.

After changing, and sending the request, I finished the challenge:

This was most likely because of the type change and have nothing to do with the file change however.
