# Captcha Bypass
Looking at the Captcha system in Burpsuite, we quickly realise that it is not effective, this is because it references a captcha ID and the answer in the request,
Using tools to manipulate requests, we'll easily be able to bypass this by just repeating the same captcha ID and answer once we get a pair.

A useful tool to repeat http request is Burpsuite's intruder feature.

To use it however, we configure a payload so that Burpsuite knows what to iterate over

We can then see the requests in the attack panel:

and after the iterations, the challenge will be solved.
