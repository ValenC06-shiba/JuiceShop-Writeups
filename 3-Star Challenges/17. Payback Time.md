Going by the logic here, since this is a simple application, I wonder if we can put negative values on checkout items:

Looking at the products list, I tried updating product id 1 so that it had negative amount to see if we can get paid instead of having to pay:

Now going back to the checkout page we can see that it is indeed negative and we are getting paid instead of paying:

Completing the process and paying with our wallet, we eventually solve the challenge.
