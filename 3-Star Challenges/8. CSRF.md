# CSRF
Cross-Site Request Forgery, 


Clicking on `account` > `our user`, we can see that there is an option to change our username,
seeing the action in Burpsuite, we can see that it interacts with the server on `/profile`

Interacting with JuiceShop and its subdirectories through the html editor however, we see that our request was blocked:

In the challenge hints, we find the reason for this:

Following the challenge clue we now need to use an outdated browser which still allows cross-site interaction.
After doing so, we can continue to type out our payload in the given html editor:
```
<form name="payload" action="http://localhost:3000/profile" method="POST">
<input type="text" name="username" value="something new">
</form>

<script> document.payload.submit(); </script>
```

The simple payload shown creates a form called "payload" sends a POST request to the profile subdirectory, in the original profile page, when inspecting the username text area, we can find that it has a "Text" type and named "username", providing these params to the request, we can edit the value of the text box (effectively changing the username).

After the form is submitted, the challenge should be solved.
