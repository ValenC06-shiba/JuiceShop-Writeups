# API-only XSS
We need to find a way to trigger the XSS payload <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> without using the UI

This meant that we need to find a way to make the website read something(our javascript payload) without using the UI

For example, when I go to the scoreboard page, the system should do a GET request to the server so that it can display the scoreboard, 
with this, I can potentially do a PUT request so that one of the scoreboard parameters gets changed to the payload.

# Scoreboard
Here I recognize the request to the scoreboard, but no responses, maybe I should try to request just `api/Challenges`

<img width="900" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e566cbd7-a319-485d-a596-c1175b0778ab" /><br/><br/>

*Yes, the server responds with all the challenge information.
Now, since I want to try and change the name of challenge 1 for example, I'll request the first challenge and change the parameters*

Following the original request format, I changed the request as such:

Then I realised this could get quite **messy** as all the contents are stored in what looks like a JSON of JSONs and the content was huge so I decided to look for other means of exploitation.


# Products
Next, I found the products request when adding a product to the basket

Looking at the structure, I can see that each product is stored in their own file, this is perfect as I can just replace the some of the contents with my own malicious payload.

Here, I went for the first product ID.

Now all I did was change the request header to PUT, add the content type(application/json), and added the payload to the "description" section.
This is to change the value of the Descrption section of the product to our own payload.

*Note that we need to escape the double quotes in the middle so that it doesn cause any errors

After this, JuisceShop should detect the XSS and complete the challenge.
