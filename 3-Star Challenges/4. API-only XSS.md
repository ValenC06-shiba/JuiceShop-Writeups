# API-only XSS
We need to find a way to trigger the XSS payload <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> without using the UI

This meant that we need to find a way to make the website display something(javascript payload) on screen without using the UI

Knowing this I went looking for requests that ask the api to show something:

For example, when I go to the scoreboard page, the system should request something to the server so that it displays the scoreboard,
using this, I can potentially try to change something in the request so that one of the resulting response is my own input.

Here I recognize the request to the scoreboard, but no responses, maybe I should try to request just `api/Challenges`

Yes, the server responds with all the challenge information.
Now, since I want to try and change the name of challenge 1 for example, I'll request the first challenge and change the parameters

Following the original request format, I changed the request as such:

and then I tried to add a parameter at the bottom to change the name to the payload

no luck, but its to be expected since it is a get request after all

Then I realised this won't really work since the get request returns a JSON of JSONs and looks for a JSON where the ID element is equal to 1
This means changing the value of a specific challenge would prove quite difficult.

Looking for other means, I found the products request when returning to the main screen from the scoreboard
