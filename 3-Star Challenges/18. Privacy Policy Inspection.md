# Privacy Policy Inspection
In this Challenge we are expected to prove that we read the privacy policy
The hint also mentions hovering our mouse over the privacy policy and we find some words that get hot when hovered over:

In the end, we get several words along with the link to localhost:

```
http://localhost
We may also
instruct you
to refuse all
reasonably necessary
responsibility
```

seeing as this looks like a seperated link I decided to try to go to the URL:

`http://localhost/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility`

After coming back from the URL the challenge should be solved
