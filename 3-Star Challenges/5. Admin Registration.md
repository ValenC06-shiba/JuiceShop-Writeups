# Admin Registration
Seeing as we need to create a user with higher priveleges, my first thought was to temper with the registration process to see if I can do something from there:

When registering a user we indeed see a `role` parameter in the response, we can definitely try and add our own role to the request to see if we can elevate our priveleges. 

Using Burpsuite's Repeater, I edited the request to include a parameter to change my role to admin:

And the system just accepts the POST request and we now have successfully created a new user with elevated priveleges.
