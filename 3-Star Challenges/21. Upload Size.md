# Upload Size
When trying to upload a file that is more than 100kb, the complaints form won't allow the complaint to be submitted, 
instead I opted to try and intercept and alter a valid file upload

Originally i uploaded the `x.xml` file in the request but here I altered the filename to be the rockoyu.txt file which is well over 100 kb, and the type to just text.

After changing, and sending the request, I finished the challenge:
