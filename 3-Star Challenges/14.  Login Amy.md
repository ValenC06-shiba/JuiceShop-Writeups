# Login Amy
The challenge asks us to login with Amy's original credentials, since we got the hash of he rpassword previously on *GDPR Data Exposure* challenge, 
we can try to gess her password as the hint suggests:

Seeing all the hints given, all I saw was the particularly specific time frame of "93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries".
Having this lead I decided to google it and stumbled upon a particularly relevant looking link:

Scrolling the site, we find that there is also a "One Important Final Note" section.

The section tells us that Amy most likely added dots to stregthen her password, combining this with the expanded hint of Amy's husbands name being Kif,
We can try and make our guesses from there.
Knowing that the password policy also needs an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number, 
we can be quite confident that the password would look something like `K1f..........` since that was also the example format described in the website

After sending a failed login request, I copied the request into Burpsuite's Intruder tab and launched the bruteforce attack:

Finally we wait and get the correct password `K1f.....................` with 21 periods:
