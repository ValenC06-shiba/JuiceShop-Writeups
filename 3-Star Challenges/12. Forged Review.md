# Forged Review
We are asked to post a product review under another user or change the existing review of another user.

Here I have a sample of a review to be submitted, After sending the PUT request, we see the parameters involved in the transaction:

Seems pretty straightforward enough since there is only the author parameter to be changed, lets try that again, changing the author param on the next request:
Modifying the request to have admin as the author, we can solve the challenge:

# Changing other users reviews
Alternatively, we can see the contents and ID of a products reviews in a GET request in burpsuite when we click on a review:

To change the contents of the reviews, we first try to change the contents of our own review and see the PATCH request that follows:

To change another users review, we simply need to duplicate this request and change the ID and message accordingly.
