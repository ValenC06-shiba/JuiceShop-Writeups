# Product Tampering
Long story short I tried to do an SQL injection but couldnt get the syntax quite right since SQLite doesnt allow multi queries in 1 line..
So I ended up with the API/RESTful calls.

Similarly to the previous API challenges, I went to the products api and changed the json data remembering to change the content type to application/json

Updating the database description of the product to the required link, I checked on the product description and it successfully redirects to `https://owasp.slack.com`

Now I was confused here as I tried multiple variations of the description with the correct link put the challenge just didnt want to solve, 
it was only until i went to the product page again did it solve so... yeah
