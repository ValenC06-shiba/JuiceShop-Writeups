4. This step took some time as I have no experience in this,
   but I eventually found a reliable website to convert a seed into a private key: `https://iancoleman.io/bip39/`
   In the website select 12 words for the 12 words that are used in the comment `purpose betray marriage blame crunch monitor spin slide donate sport lift clutch`
   Set the coin type as ethereum.

5. Copy the first private key that appears
  `0x5bcc3e9d38baa06e7bfaab80ae5957bbe8ef059e640311d7d6d465e6bc948e3e`
