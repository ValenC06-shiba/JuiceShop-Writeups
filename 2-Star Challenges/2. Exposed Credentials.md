# Exposed Credentials
"A developer was careless with hardcoding unused, but still valid credentials for a testing account on the client-side."

The description of the challenge suggests that there are some credentials hidden in the source code that are still valid, with this said, 
we can try to find it:

In main.js, I tried to find some common phrases for credentials such as "password", "username", etc.

And with that we found the credentials, to complete the challenge, simply login with the newly discovered credentials.
