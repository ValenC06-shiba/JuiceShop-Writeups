# Password Strength
"Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection."

The description along with the tag bruteforce suggests that we could try forcing our way to log in, 
but since I'm Lazy i decided to take a look at the hint to see if there were any easier ways

Seeing that the password is said to be guessable, I'm thinking that the password is very generic now.
So then I tried a few generic passwords such as `password`, `123456`, `admin`, etc.

After some time, I finally got the correct password of `admin123`.

P.S. if you don't know the admin user email already, you can try to use the SQL injection attack to get it or 
alternatively, as the original challenge solution suggests, going to product reviews 1 by 1 to find a product thats reviewed by the admin.
