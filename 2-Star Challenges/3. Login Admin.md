# Login Admin
This challenge requires us to login as admin, of course for queries such as these, SQL injections come to mind.

# Success !!
The SQLi ended up working and logged us in as admin meaning that the first user in the database is the admin user.
This is because the logic behind the query becomes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' or 1=1 `, since there are no '' users, the query looks at the second
expression and evaluates it to true, so now the query selects the first valid user it can find (1=1 -> true -> any valid user)

This is because of improper input sanitisation for SQl queries such as:

`query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"`<br/>
`cursor.execute(query)`

Where input from the user is directly put into the query to be executed.


# Best Practice
SQL injections are like formatted string attacks where inputting special characters can manipulate the code to work not as intended.
To prevent this its best to use prepared statements such as: 

`query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"`<br/>
`execute(query, (username, password))`

These are safe queries as they do not directly add user input to the query potentially allowing for SQL injections
