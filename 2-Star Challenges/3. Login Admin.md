# Login Admin
This challenge requires us to login as admin, of course for queries such as these, SQL injections come to mind.

With that said, I tried to use 2 different SQL injections:

# Success !!
Both of the SQLi ended up working and logged us in as admin maening that both "admin" and "" usernames redirect to the admin user.

This is because of improper input sanitisation for SQl queries such as:

`query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"`<br/>
`cursor.execute(query)`


# Best Practice
SQL injections are like formatted string attacks where inputting special characters can manipulate the code to work not as intended.
To prevent this its best to use prepared statements such as: 

`query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"`<br/>
`execute(query, (username, password))`

These are safe queries as they do not directly add user input to the query potentially allowing for SQL injections
