# Admin Section
"Access the administration section of the store."

The description is quite vague at first, but after thinking about it I decided to try out the simplest solution which was
going to the "administration" subdirectory.

Surprisingly it works, this shouldn't be the case in most real world scenarios though as the administration section of a website 
should exclusively be available to system operators and given proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access such as these. Gaining access to 
the administration panel such as this we could do a lot of damage such as stealing data, impersonating other customers, etc.
