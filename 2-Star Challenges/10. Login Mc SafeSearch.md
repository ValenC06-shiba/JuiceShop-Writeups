# Login Mc SafeSearch
Since we were just at the administration panel, we can easily find Mc SafeSearch's email as `mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op`

In the Hints section we are linked to a video where Mc SafeSearch blunders his password as `Mine’s my dog, Mr. Noodles. It don’t matter if you know
because I was tricky and replaced some vowels with zeroes.`

Which obviously reveals his password to be `Mr. N00dles`

Now all thats needed to do is login
