# Visual Geo Stalking.md
"Determine the answer to Emma's security question by looking at an upload of her to the Photo Wall and use it to reset her password via the Forgot Password mechanism."
As suggested by the challenge description, we do a similar thing to the meta geo stalking challenge

1. Get the file from the photowall

2. Go reset Emma's password (username can be found in /administration subdirectory)

3. Here we can see in the picture there is a flag for IT SEC

4. Try the variations for `IT SEC` and get that the correct form is `ITsec`
