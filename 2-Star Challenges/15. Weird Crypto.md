# Weird Crypto
The challenge is for us to identify an algorithm used by the system that they should, wether it be because its unsecure or outdated.

Following this, the most logical action is to check the session ID of the application to see what encryption it uses:
1. Log in as a valid user
2. Check the developer tools for JWTs or session IDs (these have the session connections likely containing sensitive information (that should be encrypted) as well):

3. We got the JWT, now since the JWT uses base 64 encoding we first need to decode it :

Here we can see an encryption algorithm used for the password most likely using a sort of hash

4. Using a Hash analyzer we find that its a md4/md5 encrypted string

5. Submit the answer in feedback as instructed by the challenge:
