Here I understood that I needed to find a place where I can upload files and potentially upload an XML file to make a b2b order.

Long Story Short, I found a place where I could upload files in "Complaints", then I simply uploaded an XML file and the challenge was solved.

P.S. the XML file doesnt need any contents, simply upload an empty file with the XML extension and it will work
