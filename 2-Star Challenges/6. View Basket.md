# View Basket
For this challenge, I tried to first see what happens when I go to my own basket in Burpsuite:

<img width="1211" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/118d241b-cbc2-4c2f-86ee-5d4e7fbb36e9" /><br/><br/>

At first, I found this specific request to be a little suspicious since there was just a random `6` as the response of refreshing the basket.
Afterwards, I tried to add some items to the current basket:

<br/><br/>

Now there was a PUT request to the system and the response contained some valuable information indeed including a `BasketId`.
This means that each user basket has their own BasketId and that to solve the challenge we simply need to access the other baskets.

# Unintentional Manipulate Basket Challenge
At first I tried to simply change the request so that the BasketId changes, but it seems I encountered some access control seen as `noUpdate constraint`.
However, going back to JuiceShop, it looks like the request did successfully get executed since I apparently solved a different challenge: `Manipulate basket`

Seeing the accidental solve I was a little confused but after more careful observation, I saw that after interacting with the basket, 
there were always 2 GET requests following it, and they contained the Current Basket Information After we made any changes.

After interacting, it looks like the old basket's content was deleted and replaced with the new content after it was changed, 
now I was left with looking for a way to exploit this, and thats when I noticed, the URL in Burpsuite always goes to /rest/basket/1 after each change.

Now I wonder, thats the URL in Burpsuite, but in the main page there were no trailing number, so I wondered, what would happen if I manually added the numbers to the URL?
TL:DR ~ The Application didn't do anything and stopped a while for me.

# Solution
Similar to the previous idea, I then tried to change the request directory directly in burpsuite:

<img width="1596" height="842" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75adcd95-521f-4f4b-bbf2-176dce36df73" /><br/><br/>

Notice that I changed the 1 in the first line of the request to a 2 and sent the request to receive a success message.

I was excited to see that it worked, but going back to JuiceShop, when i refreshed the page, it gave an error screen, BUT the challenge had been marked as solved.

So I guess this wasnt a very legitimate solution, seeing as JuiceShop most likely used this specific request as their baseline to check for challenge completion or not since we havent actually seen another user's basket in the GUI

# Satisfied Final Solution
Being unsatisfied with the previous solution, I took a look at the developer tools to search for clues, and in the applications tab, I saw that there was a Session Storage with the basket number there, Now I Wondered if changing that would do anything and wouldn't you know it turned out that was the real solution all along.

# Final Thoughts
Seeing the unsatisfying solve of this challenge, i felt that there were better ways to get to the solution even though we did see the contents of other baskets in the response of the request, since the app crashed I felt that it was a little cheating. With that said, the accidental solve for Manipulate basket also felt like cheating since we didnt actually get any confirmation of the changes that we requested.
