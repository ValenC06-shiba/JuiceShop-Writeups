# View Basket
For this challenge, I tried to first see what happens when I go to my own basket in Burpsuite:

At first, I found this specific request to be a little suspicious since there was just a random `6` as the response of refreshing the basket.
Afterwards, I tried to add some items to the current basket:

<br/><br/>

Now there was a PUT request to the system and the response contained some valuable information indeed including a `BasketId`.
This means that each user basket has their own BasketId and that to solve the challenge we simply need to access the other baskets.

# Unintentional Manipulate Basket Challenge
At first I tried to simply change the request so that the BasketId changes, but it seems I encountered some access control seen as `noUpdate constraint`.
However, going back to JuiceShop, it looks like the request did successfully get executed since I apparently solved a different challenge: `Manipulate basket`

# Final Solution
Seeing the accidental solve I was a little confused but after more careful observation, I saw that after interacting with the basket, 
there were always 2 GET requests following it, and they contained the Current Basket Information After we made any changes.

After interacting, it looks like the old basket's content was deleted and replaced with the new content after it was changed, 
now I was left with looking for a way to exploit this, and thats when I noticed, the URL in Burpsuite always goes to /rest/basket/1 after each change.

Now I wonder, thats the URL in Burpsuite, but in the main page there were no trailing number, so I wondered, what would happen if I manually added the numbers
