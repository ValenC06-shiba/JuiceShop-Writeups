# Reflected XSS 
In this type of XSS attack, we directly input the payload into the URL not through UI input.

One of the places where we can input this is through ID's, for example, the URL shows an ID for orders, we can manipulate this ID to see if it can execute a payload:

# Make Order
If you havent already, we need an order for this to work, we can just fill in any placeholder details as long as we can generate the order and order ID:

# Track Order

Now when we click on Track Order(Truck Icon) we can see in the URL the Order ID:

# Inject XSS Payload
Now we inject the payload into the URL just after `?id=`

With that we Solve the challenge
