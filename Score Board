The first step is finding the Score board so i began by playing around with the UI of the application and didnt find any scoreboards

Assuming my eyes aren't that bad, I decided to take a more detailed approach by using the inspect tool on the browser to look for more clues

There I found several js files on the sources panel, and seeing as we're looking for a scoreboard, I decided to go to the main.js file and search for a subdirectory beginning with "score"
